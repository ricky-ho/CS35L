1. man -K <keywords> 
   I found the command by reading through "man man".

2. The mv program is located in /usr/local/cs/bin/mv.
   The sh program is located in /usr/bin/sh.
   I used the command "whereis mv" and "whereis sh".

3.
   ar - creates, modifies, and extracts from archives. 
   pr - converts text files for printing. 
   tr - translates or deletes characters.
   I first used "echo $PATH" to identify all directories.
   Then I used "find <directory> -name '?r' -executable" on each directory.
   This gave me the results: ar, pr, and tr. Then I used "man ar, man pr, man tr" 
   to figure out what they do.

4. The file /etc/alternatives/emacs is executed.
   I typed /usr,/bin, and /usr/bin, in which the shell prompted that they were
   directories. Then when I typed /usr/bin/emacs, it executed the emacs program,
   which meant that this was a symbolic link. Then I used "man -k symbolic" and
   found the command "readlink" and used "readlink /usr/bin/emacs" to get the answer. 
5. /usr/bin/gcc - version 4.8.5 and gcc - version 8.2.0
   They are different programs because the newer version (8.2.0) has newer 
   features and newer implementations. I used "man -k gcc" and found that adding
   "--version" would give its version info.
   Thus the command "gcc --version" and "/usr/bin/gcc --version" provided the answer.
 
6. u+sx sets user ID upon execution and gives users execute permission.
   o-w removes the permission to write for others. 
   I used "man chmod" to find information on permissions. 

7. find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28
   I used the command "man find" to help answer this question.

8. 290
   I used "man find" to determine the type for symbolic links. Then I used
   "whereis find" to determine the directory where find is located. There were 
   too many symbolic links so I used "man -k number of lines" to find a command to
   display the number of lines, i.e. the number of symbolic links
   ("find /usr/bin -type l | nl")

9. librom1394.so.0.3.0
   I was first reading through the manual page for find but could not find anything. 
   Then I decided to go directly into the /usr/lib64 directory using "cd /usr/lib64"    and used "ls" to see what files were in the directory. I used "man ls" and found 
   that "ls -lt" would list all the files in order of newest to oldest modified time
   thus the last file was librom1394.so.0.3.0. 

10. The locale command gets its data from localedef.
    I looked through "man locale" to figure out locale's function. The manual said
    that locale displays the current locale settings based on the settings of the 
    environment variables that control the locale. From this I decided to use
    "man -k locale" and found "localedef" which states that it defines the locale 
    environment.  

11. 
    downcase-dwim    M-x ... Ret
    downcase-region  C-x C-l
    downcase-word    M-l
    I entered into emacs and looked through the manual and found the command "C-h a"
    which allowed me to search through the manuals for a keyword.

12. 
    'C-M-s'
       Begin incremental regexp search ('isearch-forward-regexp').

    'C-M-r'
       Begin reverse incremental regexp search ('isearch-backward-regexp').

    'C-M-t' ('transpose-sexps') switches the positions of the previous
       balanced expression and the next one.  It is analogous to the 'C-t'
       command, which transposes characters.

    'C-M-u'
       Runs the command backward-up-list, which is an interactive
       compiled Lisp function. It moves backward up past one unmatched
       opening delimiter.  A positive argument serves as a repeat count; a
       negative argument reverses the direction of motion, so that the command
       moves forward and up one or more levels.

    'C-M-v'
       Scroll the next window ('scroll-other-window').
    I looked through the Emacs Manual under Key Index.

13. 'C-g' cancels a command before it has finished and is the way to get rid
    of a partially typed command, or a numeric argument that you don't want.  
    I looked through the Emacs Manual under Command Index.

14. 'yank' is bound to 'C-y' and it basically reinserts ("paste") the last
    stretch of killed text. More precisely, it reinserts the most recent kill.
    I searched through the Emacs Manual and used 'C-s' to search for the word 'yank'

15. The difference between "ls -l" in the shell and "dired" in emacs was that dired
    also displayed the current directory and parent directory in its list of files.  
    I used the command "cd /usr/bin" and "ls -l" to view the contents in the /usr/bin
    directory with their permissions. In emacs, I used 'C-x d' and entered in
    "/usr/bin" to display the contents.
