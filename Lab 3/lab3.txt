CS35L Lab 3:

1. Download the Coreutils-8.29, signature, and GNU keyring files 
Command: wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
Command: wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
Command: wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

2. Verify the signature with the GNU keyring
Command: gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
There were no problems with this verification. However, there was a warning 
that said "This key is not certified with a trusted signature! There is no 
indication that the signature belongs to the owner." I think this warning 
comes from the fact that we are all using this same exact key i.e. it is for
public use thus giving us the warning.

3. Untar and unzip the Coreutils file 
Command: tar -xf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
The -xf options for tar basically extracts all files from the archive.tar 

4. Go into the Coreutils-8.29 directory
Command: cd coreutils-8.29

5. Make our own temporary directory to install coreutils into
Command: mkdir coreutilsInstall

6. Compile and install coreutils into our own temporary directory
Command: vim INSTALL     then press '/' and search for prefix
Command: pwd
Command: ./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classyho/CS35L/Lab3/coreutils-8.29/
	 coreutilsInstall
Command: make
Command: make install
I searched through the INSTALLS text file and searched for prefix to figure out
how to install coreutils into our own temporary directory. This is done through
the ./configure --prefix=<absolute_file_name> command. In order to get the 
absolute file name, I used the command 'pwd' and copied it into the configure
script. Once the configuration script has finished, we can simply use the
commands 'make' and 'make install' to compile and install coreutils into our
temporary directory (coreutilsInstall).

7. Reproduce the bug on our machine with the unmodified version of coreutils
Command: cd coreutilsInstall/bin
Command: ./ls -aA
In order to reproduce the error, we have to go into the coreutilsInstall 
directory and into its bin directory. Then we run the command ./ls -aA 
which showed the directories . and .. which is the bug because the -A is 
supposed to override the -a.

8. Create a patch file for the bug
Command: cd ../..    to go back to the coreutils-8.29 directory
Command: vim patch.diff
Next, I went back to the coreutils-8.29 directory and created a file called 
patch.diff using vim. Then I copy and pasted the patch provided by the professor
in Bug#30963 Message#10.

9. Apply the patch
Command: man patch
Command: patch -p1 < patch.diff
I looked through the manual page for patch to find out what the -pnum options
were. Since the patch had paths beginning with 'a/' (for example, a/src/ls.c),
I needed to get rid of the 'a/' to get src/ls.c . From the man page, I figured
out that the option must be -p1. 

10. Recompile/build the patched files
Command: make
Command: man autoreconf
Command: autoreconf -f -i
Command: make
After applying the patch, we have to recompile the files in order to see the 
effects, thus I used the command 'make'. However, while the files were
compiling, I suddenly got a warning saying that I was missing Automake-1.15.
I was stuck on figuring out how to resolve this warning so I asked my TA, and
they told me to look at the command 'autoreconf'. After reading through the 
manual page, I figured out that I had to use the -f and -i option, thus I used
'autoreconf -f -i' to resolve the Automake-1.15 warning. After that, I was able
to recompile the files using 'make'. This time, I did not use 'make install' 
after make because the Lab spec told us to build but not install the fixed 
version of coreutils.

11. Test that the modified ls works while the unmodified ls does not work.
Command: coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -aA
Command: coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -Aa
Command: src/ls -aA
Command: src/ls -Aa
We are currently still in the coreutils-8.29 directory, thus in order to check
the unmodified ls command, I typed 'coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -aA' and as 
expected, it still displayed the . and .. directories. I also typed 
'coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -Aa' to make sure the . and .. directories were 
displayed. Now, to check the modified ls, I used the command 'src/ls -aA' and
as expected, the . and .. directories were NOT displayed as a result of the
patch. To ensure that there was no bug in the -a and -A options, I also used
the command 'src/ls -Aa' and as expected, the . and .. directories were 
displayed since the -a overrode the -A.
